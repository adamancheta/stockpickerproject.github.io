        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', serif">Where is the data from?</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The data for the Best Stock picker is going to be from Yahoo Finance, one of the biggest and most well established finance online services. This online service allows access to data and finances on certain companies. 
        With relation to the data that we are selecting, it is a large file size. We can download this from the website as an excel or as a csv. This is a large spreadsheet, we will have to shrink down the data to fit the data size requirements for the project. 
        We are going to be downloading the data from yahoo finance and select the most traded stocks within the last 5 years. 
        </p>

        <h2 style ="font-family: 'Courier New', serif" >Plan for Analysis</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The plan for analysis is to first download data for the 10 most bought stocks in 2024 from Yahoo Finance, filter the data to only include the last 5 years of trading, clean the data, and normalize the data to account for different stock price ranges. 
           Then we will identify trends and patterns in stock performance, calculate key financial metrics for each stock (e.g. annual returns, volatility, etc.), compare the performance of the selected stocks against major market indices, then analyze the correlation between different stocks and external factors such as market events and overall economic indicators. 
           We will be creating static visualizations such as a line chart showing the price history of selected stocks, a bar chart comparing the annual returns for each stock, and a heatmap displaying the correlation between the stocks. In terms of interactive visualizations, we plan on creating an interactive line chart that allows users to select specific stocks and time ranges along with a scatter plot with selectable axes to compare stock performance.

        <h2 style ="font-family: 'Courier New', serif" >Personal Objectives</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Adam: My personal objective for this project is to complete a data analysis project and show visualizations that analyze the stock market. I think that this will be cool as we can explain complex data and show interesting correlations with the data from Yahoo Finance. 
        </p>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Sasheen: My personal objective for this project is to learn how to build a website in order to present static and interactive data visualizations. I also want to build upon on only my design skills but also my skills revolving around analyzing and interpreting data.
        </p>    
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Sonal: My personal objective for this project is to enhance my ability to create exciting visualizations through an analytical lens. I also want to dive deeper into expanding my overall knowledge about the stock market, since I’m very interested in finance, and be able to explain certain interesting trends, behaviors, and patterns in the data.</p>
