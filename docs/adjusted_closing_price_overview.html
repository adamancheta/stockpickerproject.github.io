          <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> This visualization shows the average of high closing prices, low closing prices, the trading volume, and the adjusted close through a drop down that changes the data in the axes. Adding the average amount of trading volume within a given year is intersting, because it allows us to see which stocks are most traded and compare this with the price of the stocks. This interactive plot allows us to see the coorelations between trading volume and changes for the 10 most traded stocks. This scatter plot allows us to have a more broad perspective of the last 5 years and include differrent variables that affect closing price.</p>
          <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Some of the key takeways from this visualizatios are that Apple has a higher trading volume than the other tech companies and through time this allows us to compare with investors making money. As for the adjusted close this was average close per year and this was intersting as it allows us to capture growth or loss of the stock depending on the year. </p>
