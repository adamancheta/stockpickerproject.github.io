                        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">This visualization shows the closing stock prices and the dates for each quarter within the years of 2019-2023. This Altair plot allows us to see the fluctuations and determine which quarters are the best performing. From this data, perhaps we can analyze a good selling price and put in a sell order with a brokerage to make have some potential profit. It is also interesting to see how the prices of the top 10 most traded stocks had changed from the COVID-19 pandemic and if there were a recession compare this to the pandemic.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">From this plot we can determine that within the last year Nvidia has the highest closing price at around $920. Additionally, every company dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, most of the companies made a resurgence and started having an upward trajectory. While most of the companies had an upward trajectory, Intel was a company that remained stagnant from 2020-2024.</p>
