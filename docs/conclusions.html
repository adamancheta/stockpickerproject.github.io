                Throughout the entirety of this project, The Best Stock Picker, we have gained lots of insight into data analysis, website building, presenting static vs. interactive visualizations, and many other skills for the 10 most traded stocks from 2019-2024. The data from the 2019-2024 allowed us to explore the fluctuations of the 10 most traded stocks during a time of recession and a time of recovery. Clearly from the interactive graphs, Nvidia has been the best performing stock in terms of percentage growth and annual return rate of about 80%. Within the last 5 years, this will allow an investor to almost 5x their money and build their wealth. 
                It is never too early to get ahead of the curve and start investing when your young, because this money will compound and grow into a large amount of wealth. Throughout this project, the data from Yahoo Finance has allowed us to find companies, visualize the growth rate and consitency of trends, and make decisions about investing based on simple factors like closing price, operning price, trading volume, and other variables.

                If we were to invest, we would probably choose companies that are expanding or have new projects in the technology sector. With the recent growth and advancements in AI, this has allowed automation for many things to happen. From our graphs, we would choose to put some of our money in NVDA, AAPL, and MSFT as these are some of the companies that have the highest average annual growth rates from 2019-2024. Some of us actually invest and have been able to capture lots of wealth from the investments that were made. By starting early in investing, not spending the money on commodities, and analyzing historical trends using data analysis
                one will be able to grow their wealth and ensure that they are financially stable in the future.

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', serif">What are the next steps?</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
            We feel that we did a good job finding the data, cleaning it, and creating visualizations that demonstrate the different price levels, average annual return, percent change, and coorelations of the 10 most traded stocks. However, we understand that we are students and can improve this project alot or continue the project with next steps.
            <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Some of the next steps are:</p>
            <li style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Get more data from outside sources </li>
           <li style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Get a data set that has a longer time period</li> 
           <li style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Implement a text parser to find common key words that could help identify economic trends</li>
           <li style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Consider more variables that relevant to peoples decisions/thoughts about stocks</li>
           <li style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Consider smaller stocks or stocks that are less traded</li>
            <li style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Find analysis and visualizaiton techniquesthat are used within asset management firms, banks, etc.</li>
