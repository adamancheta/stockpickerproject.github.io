        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">A little bit more about the Best Stock Picker!</h2>

        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Oftentimes, many people do not know what a stock is or even what investing is at all. As a group, we believe that stocks are some of the best ways to become wealthy if invested in the right endeavors.
            Some of us in the group have some experience in investing, meanwhile, it would be interesting to look at data correlations and investing. We think that looking at the 10 most bought stocks in 2024 is something that people will pay attention to. 
            If they see steady incline from the last 5 years, this will allow them to purchase the stock and have them invest in stocks. We think that there’s a lot of data on this, therefore we will need to adjust the amount of data that goes into this project. 
            As people who want to combine our interest in data and investing, we believe that the Best Stock Picker will analyze data to find future correlations.

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', serif">Where is the data from?</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The data for the Best Stock picker is going to be from Yahoo Finance, one of the biggest and most well established finance online services. This online service allows access to data and finances on certain companies. 
        With relation to the data that we are selecting, it is a large file size. We can download this from the website as an excel or as a csv. This is a large spreadsheet, we will have to shrink down the data to fit the data size requirements for the project. 
        We are going to be downloading the data from yahoo finance and select the most traded stocks within the last 5 years.
